var generateCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "generate",
	Short: "Generate template starter file for assets",
	Long: `Generate an empty starter template file for database assets such as a
migration, function, procedure or view. For example:

kumiho generate migration my_migration_name

kumiho generate function my_function_name

kumiho generate procedure my_procedure_name

kumiho generate view my_view_name`,
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(generateCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	generateCmd.PersistentFlags().String("schema", "dbo", "Custom database schema to use for the generated script")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// generateCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
